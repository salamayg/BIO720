# BIO720 Final Project - Yasser Salama
Graduate course - BIO 720 Bioinformatics

The repository is set up to contain only the shell, perl, and R scripts used for generating all of the results, as well as the text files containing the count data. The repository does not contain the read files or any subsequent files associated with the reads. The repository is not a clone of the directory on the cluster, however, all the files on the cluster can be accessed (read permission) at /home/yasser/bio720/final_project.
